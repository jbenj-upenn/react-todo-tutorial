# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Acknowledgements

This app was from following a tutorial by WebDevSimplified. This was simply to get more practice typing out code. 

## Assistance Needed

Despite following along intently and doing my best to code things out before seeing WebDevSimplified explain and code it out himself, the app does not function fully. If there are more than one to-do on the list, regardless of which one I click to say that it's completed, the checkbox for the top item is marked. I'd love a hand from anyone who can spot what I have done wrong, as my code is, to my knowledge, now identical with the original. 

# References

This app is based on a tutorial, as mentioned earlier; he left more references in the original, posted below below:
